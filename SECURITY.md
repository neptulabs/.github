# Security Policy

## Supported projects

This security policy applies to all public repositories under the **neptulabs** organization, including the Neptune Framework and related tools.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, **please do not open a public GitHub issue.**

Instead, contact us privately:

- Email: **security@neptu.com**

If available in the repository’s **Security** tab, you may also use GitHub’s **“Report a vulnerability”** feature to open a private security advisory.

When reporting, please include:

- A clear description of the issue and where you found it
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Any relevant logs, proof-of-concept code, or screenshots
- The impact you believe the issue could have

We aim to acknowledge security reports within **5 business days** and will keep you informed as we investigate and remediate.

## Public issues

Please reserve public GitHub issues for general bugs, feature requests, and questions. If a security issue is accidentally opened as a public issue, we may close it and move the discussion to a private channel.
